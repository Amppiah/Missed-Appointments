# Missed-Appointments
This Repository contains the code used for my first Python pandas project .
This is a data set of Patients who made appointment at a medical center. Some patients showed up whilst others did not .
The Patients range from Children to Adults who either suffered from conditions such as Hypertension, Alcoholism etc.
With this Data I was trying to establsih if patients not showing up for their appointments could be attributed to their ages, gender, medical conditions or they haveing insurance.
